# Airbnb Clone App 🏠

## Overview

Welcome to my Airbnb Clone project! This mobile app is designed to replicate the user experience of the popular Airbnb platform. Through this project, I aim to explore mobile app development using React Native, transitioning from my background in MERN web development. This journey involves the integration of cutting-edge technologies and tools to enhance both functionality and user experience.

## Tech Stack 🚀

-   **React Native**: The core framework for building the cross-platform mobile app, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process.
-   **Expo**: A powerful set of tools and services for building and deploying React Native applications with ease.
-   **Expo Router**: Simplifying navigation within the app, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
-   **TypeScript**: Bringing type safety and improved developer experience to the project.
-   **Clerk**: Leveraging Clerk for authentication, making user registration and login processes secure and user-friendly.
